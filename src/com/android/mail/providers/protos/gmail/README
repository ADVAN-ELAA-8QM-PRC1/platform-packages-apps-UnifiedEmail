This is a temporary directory that is being used to enable Gmail content to be shown in the
UnifiedEmail application

This code should only be used for development.  For shipping, this code (or something similar)
should go in the Gmail overlay of UnifiedEmail.  But for now, this allows us to use a single
application to test multiple content sources

This code is just a shim to register the logged in Gmail account from the device with the
AccountCacheProvider.  All subsequent uris will actually be handled by the Gmail application.
