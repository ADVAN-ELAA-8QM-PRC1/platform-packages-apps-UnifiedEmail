<!-- This is a placeholder layout is used as a template to create custom view
    CanvasConversationHeaderView in normal mode when showing sender pictures. To be able
    to get the correct measurements, every source field should be populated with data here. E.g:
    - Text View should set text to a random long string (android:text="@string/long_string")
    - Image View should set source to a specific asset -->
